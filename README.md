# dc_reporting_scripts

Script collection to generate plots for reporting done by Operations Office

**generate_files.py** - takes data i.e. reports submitted by each facility from "facility reports portal" and generates output files requested by OO

**fte_parser.py** - takes data file provided by OO on FTE and FUND, parses and generates txt file called `fte_fund_summary.txt`, which is later fed to a R script `fte_scatpie.R`. The generated output also contains publication information derived using `publications_api.py`

**fte_scatpie.R** - takes in data file generated by `fte_parser.py` and generates a scater plot for FTE vs Fund

**fund_parser.py** - takes data file provided by OO on FTE and FUND, parses and generates a JS file called `fund_content.js`, which is then fed to `distribution_plots.html`

**pub_frac.py** - takes manually downloaded JSON publications files and creates an excel file, also prints percentage of multiple facility publications

**survey_parser.py** - Takes in the survey of 2018 results from DC, parses and creates `score_content.js`, which is then fed to `distribution_plots.html`

**user_parser.py** - takes data file provided by OO on Users, parses and generates a JS file called `user_content.js`, which is then fed to `distribution_plots.html`

**distribution_plots.html** - Takes the generated JS files and uses plotly JS module to create interactive plots

**donut_plots.html & platfrom_budgets.html** - Data is manually fed (from files given by OO) and makes donut plot using plotly JS module
